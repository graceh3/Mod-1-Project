# Mod-1-Project

This project is for the completion of Mod 1 of Flatiron Data Science program.  Our group was Lois, Grace and Nan.

We compared New York Times Hardcover Best Sellers from 2008 to 2018 to Goodreads data.  We wanted to see if New York Times Best Sellers were popluar on Goodreads.

The New York Times dataset came from kaggle as a json file, but still needed quite a bit of cleaning.

We used a combination of Goodreads' API and webscraping with beautifulsoup to get data from Goodreads.
